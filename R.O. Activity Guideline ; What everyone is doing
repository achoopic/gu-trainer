This is all the members of R.O. and what they are doing to contribute to R.O. :

khonkhortisan's goal / what they are doing : 

alezakos's goal / what they are doing :

Snake12534's goal / what they are doing : July 15, 2013 : I added Q & A section, I then edited it and added another question, also improving little points of organization.
My goal for tomorrow : No idea at this point.

achoopic's goal (Pac-man, apeman) / what they are doing :
1. ETA 16 October 2013: I am working on the pyrJumpHelper plugin. AFAIK no one is able to help me (TBH the only help I need is with testing, light discussion and getting me motivated.)
2. ETA 31 July 2013: I am soon to release a GU/pillbox simple 3-shot dodge trainer as RO's first release.
3. ETA 22 Auguest 2013: I hope to release RO's second release, a GU match map that supports teleportation and time travel to make solo and group practice much much more efficient.
4. The next project I am dreaming of is a rico trainer. It won't be very sophisticated and the point is to build pattern recognition and train the spatial geometry unit.

R.O.'s goal : To Finish GU-Trainer (Not Close to Finish)
